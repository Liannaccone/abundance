# Abundance

Abundant is your solution for helping your neighbors elimate food waste in the Bay Area. The idea is simple. You have extra limes growing in your backyard. Your neighbors have an abundance of tomatoes this year. Instead of going to the market down the street to buy produce, you can instead connect with your neighbor and exchange your extra produce that would otherwise go to waste!

## Deployment

Deployed with Heroku: *****INSERT DEPLOYED LINK*****

## Built With

* [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) - Heroku is a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages that is used as a web application deployment model.
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
* [Bootstrap](https://bootstrapdocs.com/v4.0.0/) - Bootstrap is a frontend user experience we used to give our page a clean and user friendly appearance.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Google Fonts for users to select their own font.
* [mySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) - MySQL Workbench is a unified visual tool for database architects, developers, and DBAs. MySQL Workbench provides data modeling, SQL development, and comprehensive administration tools for server configuration, user administration, backup, and much more. MySQL Workbench is available on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
* [bcrypt-nodejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) - Optimized bcrypt in JavaScript with zero dependencies. 
* [BodyParser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser-json) - Node.js body parsing middleware. This does not handle multipart bodies, due to their complex and typically large nature. 
* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.
* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs. Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over 14 template engines via Consolidate.js, you can quickly craft your perfect framework.
* [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars) - As of version 3.x, Express got out of the business of being a generic view engine — this was a great decision — leaving developers to implement the concepts of layouts, partials, and doing file I/O for their template engines of choice.
* [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) - Create a session middleware with the given options. Session data is not saved in the cookie itself, just the session ID. Session data is stored server-side.
* [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) - This is a node.js driver for mysql. It is written in JavaScript, does not require compiling, and is 100% MIT licensed.
* [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) - MySQL client for Node.js with focus on performance. Supports prepared statements, non-utf8 encodings, binary log protocol, compression, ssl much more.
* [passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport) - Passport is Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js. Passport's sole purpose is to authenticate requests, which it does through an extensible set of plugins known as strategies. Passport does not mount routes or assume any particular database schema, which maximizes flexibility and allows application-level decisions to be made by the developer. The API is simple: you provide Passport a request to authenticate, and Passport provides hooks for controlling what occurs when authentication succeeds or fails.
* [passport-local](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport-local) - Passport strategy for authenticating with a username and password. This module lets you authenticate using a username and password in your Node.js applications. By plugging into Passport, local authentication can be easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports Connect-style middleware, including Express.
* [sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) - Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, read replication and more.
